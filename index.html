          <p><strong>Niles Rivers</strong> is a multi-talented performer, songwriter, and teacher whose voice has moved strangers to tears and whose presence lights up every stage he stands on. From starring as Simba in Disney’s *The Lion King* to collaborating with legendary producer David Foster, Niles brings decades of storytelling through sound, rhythm, and character. His work blends excellence, heart, and healing—and invites others to do the same.</p>
          <p>This gallery is more than pictures. It's a window into the journey, the performances, the moments of stillness and spark. You're invited not just to view—but to respond, reflect, and engage. Let the images move you. Let the music guide you. And if one photo speaks, let it be the beginning of your own echo.</p>
