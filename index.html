Can you see me now?
Do you know that I’m with you?
Emmanuel, I’ll show the world that I picked you
And I’ll make you brand new
And I said, "Thank you for restoring my youth”
And He said…
It’s what I Long to do
I Am the Blessing that I give to you
This is the Reason that I’m saving you
So you can have More of what I made for you
All you have to do is Believe that I love you so deep
And my Love goes beyond your wildest dreams
I’m always right here even though you can’t see
I'm all that you need
It’s all in me,
And I want to give you everything
This is my Longing

You made the earth and everything in it
You made me a man, and formed me in your image
Lord, there’s no one like you
And I said, "Thank you for showing me Truth"
And He said…
It’s what I Long to do
I Am the Blessing that I give to you
This is the Reason that I’m saving you
So you can have More of what I made for you
All you have to do is believe that I love you so deep
And my Love goes beyond your wildest dreams
I’m always right there even though you can’t see
I'm all that you need
It’s all in me
And I want to give you everything
This is my Longing

This is my Longing
This is my Longing

It’s what I Long to do
I Am the Blessing that I give to you
This is the Reason that I’m saving you
So you can have more…

It’s what I Long to do
I Am the Blessing that I give to you
This is the Reason that I’m saving you
So you can have more…

It’s what I Long to do
I Am the Blessing that I give to you.

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-base">
            “The Longing” is about the sorrow in His love—not the kind that’s angry or impatient, 
            but the ache of wanting to give us everything, and watching us doubt it.<br><br>
            He died to give us fullness. To pour out mercy, identity, healing, and nearness. 
            But so often, we hold back from receiving it—not because we’re proud, 
            but because we quietly don’t believe He could really love us that much.<br><br>
            This song came from a dream, but it carries something that feels bigger than me. 
            If it reaches you, I pray it softens the places that have forgotten they’re loved.<br><br>
            If it speaks to you, receive it freely—or give what you feel led to.
