  <p>
    Hi, my name is <strong>Niles Levi Rivers</strong>, and I’m a singer, an actor, a musician, a storyteller, and a father with a voice and a heart that has carried me through some high places—and some hard ones, too.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ve had the honour of recording with David Foster, playing Simba in <em>The Lion King</em>, winning a songwriting contest judged by Prince, and creating some other beautiful memories. But the moments that matter most? It’s when a stranger stops in tears and says, “I needed that.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Recently, I stepped away from the spotlight due to injury. It’s been humbling, but it’s deepened the humanity in my art. I’ve never chased fame. I’ve always chased the truth.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is my season — not late, not behind. Just right. Because what I carry now couldn’t have come any other way. This voice, this gift, is my calling. And it’s got something to say.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you believe in second acts, in resurrection, or just in real stories that breathe, I’d love for you to walk with me. In this “Walk by the River,” you’ll hear the pain and the joy, the wrestle and the win. I want to connect — first as human, then as a trusted friend.
  </p>
