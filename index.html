Can you see me now?
Do you know that I’m with you?
Emmanuel, I’ll show the world that I picked you
And I’ll make you brand new
And I said, "Thank you for restoring my youth”
And He said…
It’s what I Long to do
I Am the Blessing that I give to you
This is the Reason that I’m saving you
So you can have More of what I made for you
All you have to do is Believe that I love you so deep
And my Love goes beyond your wildest dreams
I’m always right here even though you can’t see
I'm all that you need
It’s all in me,
And I want to give you everything
This is my Longing

You made the earth and everything in it
You made me a man, and formed me in your image
Lord, there’s no one like you
And I said, "Thank you for showing me Truth"
And He said…
It’s what I Long to do
I Am the Blessing that I give to you
This is the Reason that I’m saving you
So you can have More of what I made for you
All you have to do is believe that I love you so deep
And my Love goes beyond your wildest dreams
I’m always right there even though you can’t see
I'm all that you need
It’s all in me
And I want to give you everything
This is my Longing

This is my Longing
This is my Longing

It’s what I Long to do
I Am the Blessing that I give to you
This is the Reason that I’m saving you
So you can have more…

It’s what I Long to do
I Am the Blessing that I give to you
This is the Reason that I’m saving you
So you can have more…

It’s what I Long to do
I Am the Blessing that I give to you.

            The Longing is about the sorrow in His love—not the kind that’s angry or impatient, but the kind
            that aches with compassion. He showed me that His mercy is not just for saving me from something,
            it’s for bringing me into something deeper. A relationship. His love is not a distant light—it’s a
            closeness that mourns when we suffer, and celebrates when we return.

    <h2>Lyrics – "All We Got"</h2>
    <p style="white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto 20px;">
I'm here for Love. To be loved, to known,
as a part of a work of art and you,
You're here for love, to be loved and not owned.
Freedom starts in the earth of heart
and we both know it's gonna take
forgiving all our past mistakes
and living life a brand new day.
You and I can find a way.

We all we got and it ain't gon' take a lot
to get this love together, baby. (repeat)

I'm not here to fight, but to understand.
I don't have to be right just to be your man.
A shoulder you can lean on,
a shoulder you can cry on…
'cause all I know is Love…is love …is love no matter what.

We all we got and it ain't gon' take a lot
to get this love together, baby. (repeat)

Your love is the love I know in this world.
In this world.
Your love is the love I know in this world.

We all we got...

  <h2>Journal: Behind the Song</h2>
  <p style="font-family: 'Segoe Script', cursive; line-height: 1.9;">
    There’s a line in this song that means more to me than I can explain:<br>
    “Your love is the love I know in this world.”
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: 'Segoe Script', cursive; line-height: 1.9;">
    That’s not just a beautiful sentiment. It’s a deep reality.<br>
    The way we’re loved—especially early in life—becomes our blueprint for what love is. Whether that love is kind or cruel, present or absent, healing or harmful… it becomes the definition. Until it is challenged and changed by a greater, more patient example.
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: 'Segoe Script', cursive; line-height: 1.9;">
    A child doesn’t know to question it. They just receive it, absorb it, and carry it forward. It becomes the lens through which every future act of love is measured. So when I sing that line, I’m speaking to something sacred and sobering:
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: 'Segoe Script', cursive; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.9; margin-left: 20px;">
    “Your love is the love I know in this world.”
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: 'Segoe Script', cursive; line-height: 1.9;">
    It’s what taught me what love is, for better or worse. It shaped how I receive love, how I give it, and what I expect from it. It’s what I’ll carry into eternity as my lived understanding of love.
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: 'Segoe Script', cursive; line-height: 1.9;">
    This could be between lovers, friends, family. It could be the love that saved you… or the love that wounded you first. Either way, it leaves a mark. And that’s what this song is reaching toward—acknowledging that deep truth, that we teach each other what this powerful, invisible force is by how we love.
