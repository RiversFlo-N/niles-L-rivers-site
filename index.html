  <p>
    Hi, my name is Niles Levi Rivers, and I’m a singer, an actor, a musician, a storyteller, and a father with a voice and a heart that has carried me through some high places—and some hard ones, too.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ve had the honour of recording with David Foster, playing Simba in <em>The Lion King</em>, and winning a songwriting contest judged by Prince, among other meaningful milestones. But the moments that matter most? It’s when a stranger stops in tears and says, “I needed that.” Or when young people respond deeply—just because I shared something honest in a song.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recently, I’ve been walking through a time away from the spotlight due to a serious injury. It’s been humbling—but it’s made my art more grounded. I’m not chasing fame. I never have. I’m telling the truth.
  </p>
  <p>
    Right now, I’m rebuilding—with clarity, purpose, and a voice, because this is my season. The gift I’ve been given has something to say. If you’ve ever felt something listening to me, then you know exactly what I mean. If you believe in second acts or in Resurrection, I’d love to have you walk with me.
  </p>
  <p>
    I came up in an era where artists hid their personal lives and only showed the polished parts. But I’m choosing something real. In this “Walk with the Rivers,” you’re going to hear my struggles, my healing, and the joy in my victories. I hope these stories reach you—not just as a performance, but as a connection. As one human to another.
  </p>
