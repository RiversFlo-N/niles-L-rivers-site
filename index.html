Can you see me now?
Do you know that I’m with you?
Emmanuel, I’ll show the world that I picked you
And I’ll make you brand new
And I said, "Thank you for restoring my youth”
And He said…
It’s what I Long to do
I Am the Blessing that I give to you
This is the Reason that I’m saving you
So you can have More of what I made for you
All you have to do is Believe that I love you so deep
And my Love goes beyond your wildest dreams
I’m always right here even though you can’t see
I'm all that you need
It’s all in me,
And I want to give you everything
This is my Longing

You made the earth and everything in it
You made me a man, and formed me in your image
Lord, there’s no one like you
And I said, "Thank you for showing me Truth"
And He said…
It’s what I Long to do
I Am the Blessing that I give to you
This is the Reason that I’m saving you
So you can have More of what I made for you
All you have to do is believe that I love you so deep
And my Love goes beyond your wildest dreams
I’m always right there even though you can’t see
I'm all that you need
It’s all in me
And I want to give you everything
This is my Longing

This is my Longing
This is my Longing

It’s what I Long to do
I Am the Blessing that I give to you
This is the Reason that I’m saving you
So you can have more…

It’s what I Long to do
I Am the Blessing that I give to you
This is the Reason that I’m saving you
So you can have more…

It’s what I Long to do
I Am the Blessing that I give to you.

            The Longing is about the sorrow in His love—not the kind that’s angry or impatient, but the kind
            that aches with compassion. He showed me that His mercy is not just for saving me from something,
            it’s for bringing me into something deeper. A relationship. His love is not a distant light—it’s a
            closeness that mourns when we suffer, and celebrates when we return.

I'm here for Love. To be loved, to known,
as a part of a work of art and you,
You're here for love, to be loved and not owned.
Freedom starts in the earth of heart
and we both know it's gonna take
forgiving all our past mistakes
and living life a brand new day.
You and I can find a way.

We all we got and it ain't gon' take a lot
to get this love together, baby. (repeat)

I'm not here to fight, but to understand.
I don't have to be right just to be your man.
A shoulder you can lean on,
a shoulder you can cry on…
'cause all I know is Love…is love …is love no matter what.

We all we got and it ain't gon' take a lot
to get this love together, baby. (repeat)

Your love is the love I know in this world.
In this world.
Your love is the love I know in this world.

We all we got...

            Your love is the love I know in this world. I wrote that line not just for a song, but as a reminder—
            that even when everything else feels unfamiliar or hard, His love is constant. It’s the one thing I
            can always return to. That line became a promise to myself: I will not forget who You are.
