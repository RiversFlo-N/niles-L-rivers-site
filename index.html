  <p>
    Hi, my name is Niles Levi Rivers, and I’m a singer, an actor, a musician, a storyteller, and a father with a voice and a heart that has carried me through some high places—and some hard ones, too.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ve had the honour of recording with David Foster, playing Simba in <em>The Lion King</em>, and winning a songwriting contest judged by Prince, among other meaningful milestones. But the moments that matter most? It’s when a stranger stops in tears and says, “I needed that.” Or when young people respond deeply—just because I shared something honest in a song.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recently, I’ve been walking through a time away from the spotlight due to a serious injury. It’s been humbling—but it’s made my art more grounded. I’m not chasing fame. I never have. I’m telling the truth.
  </p>
  <p>
    Right now, I’m rebuilding—with clarity, purpose, and a voice, because this is my season. The gift I’ve been given has something to say. If you’ve ever felt something listening to me, then you know exactly what I mean. If you believe in second acts or in Resurrection, I’d love to have you walk with me.
  </p>
  <p>
    I came up in an era where artists hid their personal lives and only showed the polished parts. But I’m choosing something real. In this “Walk with the Rivers,” you’re going to hear my struggles, my healing, and the joy in my victories. I hope these stories reach you—not just as a performance, but as a connection. As one human to another.
  </p>

I'm here for Love. To be loved, to known,
as a part of a work of art and you,
You're here for love, to be loved and not owned.
Freedom starts in the earth of heart
and we both know it's gonna take
forgiving all our past mistakes
and living life a brand new day.
You and I can find a way.

We all we got and it ain't gon' take a lot
to get this love together, baby. (repeat)

I'm not here to fight, but to understand.
I don't have to be right just to be your man.
A shoulder you can lean on,
a shoulder you can cry on…
'cause all I know is Love…is love …is love no matter what.

We all we got and it ain't gon' take a lot
to get this love together, baby. (repeat)

Your love is the love I know in this world.
In this world.
Your love is the love I know in this world.

We all we got...

    <!-- Description -->
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-base">
      “The Longing” is about the sorrow in His love—not the kind that’s angry or impatient, 
      but the ache of wanting to give us everything, and watching us doubt it.<br><br>
      He died to give us fullness. To pour out mercy, identity, healing, and nearness. 
      But so often, we hold back from receiving it—not because we’re proud, 
      but because we quietly don’t believe He could really love us that much.<br><br>
      This song came from a dream, but it carries something that feels bigger than me. 
      If it reaches you, I pray it softens the places that have forgotten they’re loved.<br><br>
      If it speaks to you, receive it freely—or give what you feel led to.
    </p>
